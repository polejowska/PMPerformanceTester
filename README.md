# PMPerformanceTester

The project purpose is to develop an application that tests psychomotor performance.
The application estimates reflex, sight and hearing for which separate test is prepared. Proceeding each test which scores the performance, training phase is available, so that the user can experiment how the test works and what is expected.
Also, before the training phase itself, valuable information about the test appears.
Finishing all the tests, overall results show up and the user can compare himself to estimated average scores by checking the chart.

Please note that the score has no serious implications and should not be considered as health advice.

### Technologies
The project was developed entirely in Java programming language. For displaying the chart, library jfreechart was used.
